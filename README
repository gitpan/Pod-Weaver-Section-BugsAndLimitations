NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::BugsAndLimitations - Add a BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    pod section

VERSION
    version 1.20

SYNOPSIS
    In "weaver.ini":

        [BugsAndLimitations]

OVERVIEW
    This section plugin will produce a hunk of Pod that refers to the
    bugtracker URL.

    You need to use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bugtracker in your "dist.ini" file,
    because this plugin relies on information that other plugin generates.

  weave_section
    adds the "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS" section.
